# To run the Kafka test

Kafka triggered Azure Functions are created to consume from the Event Hubs named as *`-kafka-batch` or *`-kafka-message`, thus reading from the Kafka end-point on the Event Hub.

Kafka tests can be run by sending messages into either of these Event Hubs named as *`-kafka-batch` or *`-kafka-message`.

Follow the steps to run the Event Hub tests mentioned [here](../eventhub/readme.md) using the appropriate Event Hub name.
